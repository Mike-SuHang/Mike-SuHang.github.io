                    <h2>Making method of fried rice cake:
                    </h2>
                    1. Prepare the auxiliary ingredients. Red sausage can be replaced by ordinary sausage. It is recommended to cut the red sausage into shreds to remove the flavor

2. Heat the oil in a wok and fry the shallots and garlic at a low heat. The aim is to fill the oil with the shallots and garlic, and fry the garlic until it is slightly brown

3. First grind black pepper and Sichuan peppercorns into powder in a food processor, then add light soy sauce, sesame oil, homemade chili sauce, sugar, and freshly ground pepper and Sichuan peppercorns according to the proportion of ingredients

4. Add the chopped side ingredients and stir fry over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, then add the rice cake mixed with the sauce and the vegetables you like

5. Serve and sprinkle with white sesame seeds and scallion
